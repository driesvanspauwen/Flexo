# Simon

This weird machine computes [the Simon block cipher](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7167361).

## Compile the weird machine

Follow the steps in "[Compile a weird machine](../../README.md#compile-a-weird-machine)" from the [readme](../../README.md) of Flexo to compile these weird machines.
There is one weird machine inside this folder, [simon32.c](./simon32.c).
Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to compile it into LLVM IR, and then move on to the second step of the compilation process.
